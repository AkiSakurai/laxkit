note to self: 
MAKING LAXKIT DEB PACKAGE
----------------------

(if anyone has a better way of doing this, let me know, I'm new at this)

1. ----Copy trunk to a new tag------
 first make sure all the code in docs/examples still work!!

 svn copy https://laxkit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laxkit/laxkit/trunk \
          https://laxkit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laxkit/laxkit/tags/(whatever version)


2. ----modify source---
 check out the new branch:
  svn co https://laxkit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laxkit/laxkit/tags/(version)
 make sure version number is correct in any source files that refer to it, currently:
   configure docs/Doxyfile docs/docs.html docs/faq.html docs/index.html README lax/lax-config debian/changelog debian/laxkit.1 debian/liblaxkit-doc.install debian/liblaxkit.install 
 
 make sure configure defaults to 'prefix=/usr/local/'. This is what should be in a source tarball.

 svn ci -m'Last minute touchups to this tag'


3. Export a copy of the new tag and make a tarball. 
 svn export https://laxkit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laxkit/laxkit/tags/(whichever) laxkit-(version)

 cd laxkit-(version)
 ./configure  <--need to do this so the other preliminary make things are done:
 make depends  in the head directory
 make hidegarbage 
 rm -f config.log Makefile-toinclude lax/version.h lax/configured.h   <--remove cruft from ./configure
 
 cd ..
 tar cjv (the dir) > laxkit-version.tar.bz2 
   this should be the distributed tarball, also

 For dev snapshots, the version should be number-rev[SUBVERSION REVISION], so like 0.02-rev234

 unpack and test, preferrably on a different machine in a different directory


5. ---build the package---
In top laxkit directory, build the laxkit debs with this:
 dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

This often will expose otherwise unknown errors, I think because making the deb packages uses lots more
compile flags. You can do "fakeroot debian/rules binary" to not have to recompile everything after fixing.

This will currently create debs for:
  liblaxkit (includes headers)
  liblaxkit-doc
  laxinput


7. don't forget to update the website, including uploading a fresh build of the documentation
