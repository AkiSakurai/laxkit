This file is for random notes and specific coding tasks that need to be done
to meet various goals. This includes Roadmap items as well as fixing bugs.
List bug tracker number if any. This should be considered a supplement to
laidout/src/LEFT---OFF, which has a lot more laxkit related issues in it.

When an item is satisfied, put it in the DONE section at bottom of file.
Those are purged with each release.

update laxinput to have correct repository in readme..
  also implement an event viewer

TO IMPLEMENT or drastically improve:
  tableframe.o 
  colorselector.o 
  printdialog.o 
  scrolledwindow
  interfacewindow

PaletteWindow:
  hide header
  special colors
  edit palette
  load/save controls
  palette dir management
  palette list select

DateSelector needs easy way to select current date

LineEdit:
  should be able to setcurpos at any time, even without window set.. seems to not quite work at the moment

shortcut html output needs to make & -> &amp;, etc
shortcut needs mode based shortcuts implemented.. just a stub right now
shortcuts, area info? embed info?  

overwrite box in filedialog:
  in overwrite box, provide name options
  OR in file dialog, show yellow if overwriting, press down to pop up list of options

     file1.jpg exists!

	 [Overwrite][cancel]

	 v Suggestions:
	    file2.jpg
		file1-1.jpg
		file (copy).jpg
		file COPY.jpg
		  [Use instead]

merge Laxkit and LaxFiles?? makes things simpler

curvewindow:
	finish side edits
	implement full bez?
	histogram

scrollers in interfs.cc example frelled

dump_out_atts needed for:
  Gradient
  Image
  Path
  Patch
  ColorPatch
  Caption

dump_out(-1) on windows should do dump_out_atts(), then output:
   name1  #value
   name2  #value, wrapping to current indent at given column width
   ---> maybe have layout hints in Attribute::atttype?

MouseEvent needs expandable properties, such as depth or finger info

mesbar have click-destroys so undragged mouse will destroy window.. for overlay messages

usethesescrollers panner problem??

dndaware should be default

document singleton manager creators:
  resourcemanager
  shortcutmanager
  interfacemanager
  displayer manager
  iconmanager
  undomanager
  imagemanager
  unitmanager
  colormanager

for dateselector, grab whole translated names, then the first few chars of that, rather than translate abreviations

splitwindow: cursor gets stuck on wrong cursor when entering children

menuselector center with icons not placing correctly

drag out a gradient in diagonal direction, has preview image problems
drag out in negative direction, creates way off artifacts

make sure button and subclass defines are consistent

hierarchy changes are selected on Root window... special function at app level to accept such messages??
could be same function as event catch all for propagated events.

objectinterface:
 SOMEDATA_KEEP_1_TO_1

patch controls: selecting a control point should highlight what segments are affected by changing it
while moving control points should do recursive draw (faster) then update preview on mouse up
DONE not drawing boundaries correctly
DONE patch decorations has mystery render error, far out lines with some combination of showdecs

timer in popup menu causing problems...

multidevice:
 imageinterface
 pathinterface
 patches
 gradients
 viewport

need a lock shaped cursor, and a circle crossed out shape.. How to make custom cursors????

hover arrows on item selectors not showing up

up/down key should not allow being on separators

Menubutton downarrow style screws up, because considers down arrow to be a graphic in place of image, not in addition

Button down grabs device, but enter and exit still leaks through, so button windows get
multiple in events...

remove const from LaxMouse/LaxKeyboard... too much const cast stuff? or make mouse shape changing and grabbing anXApp function

xim per keyboard? related: not sure if dead keys are working anymore...

rulerwindow: should be able to use panner data? displayer data??

pointer grabs, ie for panpopup

comply with: http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html
comply with net_wm_ping --> needs testing

thumbnail spec says you are supposed to add in fields!!

~/.recently-used  OR  ~/.recently-used.xbel?? <-- old spec says 1st one....

what is behavior supposed to be on sync() if is window?? 

fix rowframe, tabframe, etc integration.. 

buttons should have modifier specific icons?



for color palettes, and other loadable things that might need translation, maybe some standard?
name Blah
  translations
    en Blaba
	fr Blaeahe
	be Blahsenfeffer
