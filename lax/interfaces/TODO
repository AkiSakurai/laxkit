\section interfaces Interfaces Todo

<pre>

transformers, so patch and paths can select many nodes, apply a transformer object
 shift the nodes, or attach transformer(s) to an image, ...


implement all the DumpUtility funtions for ALL data classes and interfaces!!! Particularly when what==-1,
then the dump_out() should dump out a psuedocode human readable mock up of what file
output for that class looks like. It should be documented enough so that someone
reading it can get a good idea of how to write code for that segment of the file.

put in a what in the dump_in_*, particularly for such like: PathsData::dump_in(FILE*, LAX_SVG)

It might be useful to separate the BlahData from BlahInterface in the *.cc and *.h
files. This enables processing all the data without the need of the windowing system.

some interfaces still don't have duplicate()

port ImagePatchInterface into the gimp to be used like the other
 rotate/perspective/etc transforms, because it is a feature that I CONSTANTLY ache for
 in the gimp!!!

perhaps have an Interface<template> : public InterfaceWithDp to knock out the basics easily..
