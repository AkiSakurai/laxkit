easy warp pointer to different screen

when removing a slave device, should only prune the master device it came from

enable/disable devices, rather than resorting to floating?

Need to have a "do not float" and "do not prune" tag

Load from config: remember grouping of devices, like all from a tablet go to same master device
 for devices not currently plugged in. Then, when you do plug in devices, they are all grouped in a single
 master of their own.

need a check to ensure that you do not float ALL your mice or keyboards!!

categories (loadable plugins?) for:
  X   wii   tuio   midi   kinect   other?

maps to tie wii ir input to XTEST pointers?

Merge this with main laxkit library so that any Laxkit based program can use this 
  configurator from their own application space, so as to more easily map input 
  to something usable, without resorting to external communication



-------------------------
9-25 DONE in config be able to auto float devices (like a touch screen that insists on giving bad inputs)
9-24 DONE drag master to same master, it removes itself!!
9-21 DONE If devices are added or removed externally, laxinput does not remaphierarchy!! anxapp is absorbing the hierarchy changes
9-21 DONE auto-background mode where any that get plugged get a new master, any empty masters are deleted
6-17 DONE should really respond to device hierarchy changes!! If you create a new device, you cannot
           actually use it without restarting laxinput!!
